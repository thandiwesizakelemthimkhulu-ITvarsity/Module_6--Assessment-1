                            <h3>MONKEY</h3>

    <p>Monkeys are a large and varied group of mammals of the primate order. 
      They live in trees, grasslands, forests, mountains and plains. 
      They are seriously threatened by habitat loss </p>

     <p>The use of monkeys as “entertainers” removes animals from their natural habitat; depriving them of the ability to freely engage in instinctual behaviors. 
      Both children and adults are desensitized to animal mistreatment by the animal entertainment industry. Whether they're at a zoo, on a film set, or under a circus tent, 
      monkeys used as entertainment are forced to perform unnatural and painful tasks through abusive training methods.
      </p>
   
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Monkeys tend to inhabit the tropical rainforests of Africa, Central America, South America and Asia. 
      All primates live in trees, with the exception of baboons that prefer to live on the ground.

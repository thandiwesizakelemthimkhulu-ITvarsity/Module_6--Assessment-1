                            <h3>WARTHOG</h3>

    <p>Phacochoerus is a genus in the family Suidae, commonly known as warthogs (pronounced wart-hog). 
       It is the sole genus of subfamily Phacochoerinae. They are pigs who live in open and semi-open habitats, 
       even in quite arid regions, in sub-Saharan Africa.. </p>

     <p>Warthogs may not be the most beautiful or graceful creatures in the Animal 
        But they are remarkable for their strength, intelligence, and flexibility! Unlike many of their African counterparts, 
        they are not endangered. This is because they are so skilled at adapting to new threats. For example, most warthogs like to forage during the light of the morning and early evening. 
        But if they live in an area where people hunt them, they switch to foraging at night.  </p>
   
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p> Common warthogs live in the grasslands and savanna woodlands of Africa. 
     They prefer open areas, and are found on Mount Kilimanjaro at an elevation of 3,000 meters (9,843 feet), according to ADW. 
     Desert warthogs are found in eastern Africa â€” in parts of Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia. </p>

                            <h3>PANDA</h3>

    <p> Eastern cultures regard Panda as a symbol of peace and luck. When Panda appears, you may find your entire outlook on life becoming brighter. 
        In nature, Panda uses its natural awareness to remain tuned into its surroundings. 
        It does not like chaos, so when you work with Panda Energy, find a calm center.</p>

     <p> The totem of the panda has affinities with bear energy. 
         Despite its gentle appearances, it is a strong animal with an unstoppable determination.</p>
   
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p> Wild pandas live only in remote, mountainous regions in central China. These high bamboo forests are cool and wetâ€”just as pandas like it. 
        They may climb as high as 13,000 feet to feed on higher slopes in the summer season.</p>

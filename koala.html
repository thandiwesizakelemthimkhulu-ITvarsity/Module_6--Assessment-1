                            <h3>KOALA</h3>

    <p> Etymology. The word koala comes from the Dharug gula, meaning no water. 
        It was at one time thought, since the animals were not observed to come down from trees often, that they were able to survive without drinking. 
        The leaves of the eucalyptus tree have a high water content, so the koala does not need to drink often.
</p>

     <p>When Koala climbs into your reality, it's time to take a well-deserved break. As your Spirit Animal, Koala is telling you, “Don't move so fast. Don't rush to that next moment.” 
      It's a fact stress and anxiety decrease joy in your daily life.</p>
   
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Koalas live in the eucalyptus forests of southeastern and eastern Australia.</p>

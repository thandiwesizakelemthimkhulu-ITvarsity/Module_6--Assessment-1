        and along the Nile. However, today giraffes are only found in sub-Sarahan Africa.  </p>
   
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Most giraffes live in grasslands and open woodlands in East Africa, especially in reserves such as the Serengeti National Park and the Amboseli National Park.
       Some are also found in the reserves of Southern Africa. </p>

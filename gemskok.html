                            <h3>GEMSKOK</h3>

    <p> The gemsbok, gemsbuck or South African oryx (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope in the genus Oryx. It is native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, such as the Kalahari Desert. 
       Some authorities formerly included the East African oryx as a subspecies. </p>

     <p>The gemsbok is polygynous, with one resident male mating with the receptive females in the herd. The male is known to secure exclusive mating access to the females by attempting to herd mixed or nursery herds onto his territory. The gemsbok has no specified breeding season, but the young in a given herd tend to be of a similar age due to reproductive synchrony between females. 
       Pregnant females leave the herd before giving birth.</p>
   
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>As one of 3 African species of the oryx genus, the gemsbok, or gemsbuck, can be found on the grasslands or savannas and on flat or hilly country in the Kalahari Desert in Southern Africa. 
      They are well adapted to the conditions of their hot, arid habitats. </p>

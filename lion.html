                            <h3>LION</h3>

    <p> The lion is a well-muscled cat with a long body, large head, and short legs. Size and appearance vary considerably between the sexes. 
          The male’s outstanding characteristic is his mane, which varies between different individuals and populations. It may be entirely lacking</p>

     <p> Though a group of hunting lions is potentially nature’s most formidable predatory force on land, 
       a high proportion of their hunts fail. The cats pay no attention to the wind’s direction (which can carry their scent to their prey), 
       and they tire after running short distances. Typically, they stalk prey from nearby cover and then burst forth to run it down in a short, rapid rush. </p>
   
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Lions live in a variety of habitats but prefer grassland, savanna, dense scrub, and open woodland. 
       Historically, they lived across much of Europe, Asia, and Africa, but now they are mainly found in parts of Africa south of the Sahara.

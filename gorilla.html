                            <h3>GORILLA</h3>

    <p> Gorillas are gentle giants and display many human-like behaviors and emotions, such as laughter and sadness. In fact, gorillas share 98.3% of their genetic code with humans, making them our closest cousins after chimpanzees and bonobos. 
        The largest of the great apes, gorillas are stocky animals with broad chests and shoulders, large, human-like hands,
        and small eyes set into hairless faces. </p>

     <p> Gorilla encounters are the ultimate wildlife experience, whether they’re mountain gorillas, Western lowland gorillas or even the rare Grauer’s gorilla.
         The sheer majesty of the silverbacks, the playfulness of the toddlers and the tenderness of their mothers are just mesmerizing. </p>
   
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Most people want to track mountain gorillas and there’s much debate as to which country offers the best mountain gorilla safari. 
      They’re found in only three countries: Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). </p>
